# My Python + AI Project Ideas

## Things I want to build
- A tool that calculates age in years/days
- A simple chatbot using LangChain
- Automations for daily tasks
- A design product demo using AI coding helpers

## Why I want to build this
I want to learn Python basics and then use AI tools (Cursor, ChatGPT, Cloud Code, etc.) to speed up development.

## Next Steps
- Set up a structured folder
- Start with small scripts
- Push everything to GitHub
